# 🍌 Banana Ripeness Classification using CNN

A deep learning project that classifies banana images into different ripeness stages using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
This model helps identify whether a banana is **Unripe, Half-ripened, Ripe, or Overripe** based on an input image.

## 📌 Project Overview

Banana ripeness detection is an important problem in agriculture, food supply chains, and retail quality control.  
In this project, a CNN-based image classification model is trained to automatically recognize banana ripeness stages from images.

The project follows a complete **Machine Learning pipeline**:
- Dataset preparation  
- Data preprocessing  
- CNN model design  
- Training & validation  
- Evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix  
- Model export for deployment
